# QuestFit
QuestFit — a personal Next.js fitness tracker that generates daily workout “quests” and auto-scales per exercise using rolling RPE, soreness, and enjoyment bias. Modular, config-driven engine with rep-scheme rotation, muscle-map corrective suggestions, and offline-friendly logging. Built for Vercel—log fast now, charts later.
